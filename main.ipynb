    "Welcome to the program of Python Pyamaze Library Modification with Searching Algorithm Study. The main goal of this program is mainly to demonstrate a modification made to an existing python package called pyamaze developed by the respectful author, <a href=\"https://github.com/MAN1986\">Muhammad Ahsan Naeem</a>. The original package source code can be found at this <a href=\"https://github.com/MAN1986/pyamaze/blob/main/pyamaze/pyamaze.py\">website</a>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The pyamaze package is used to visualize an agent's path in reaching its designated goal of a maze. The original version has only one goal as shown in the figure below.\n",

    "<img src=\"components/f1.png\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The modification that has made by me is that the maze consists of 3 goals in total. The goals will change to a different direction intervally. After the goal has changed, the agent will change it direction and move to the new goal until it reaches to the last goal evetually. This modification is made to visualize the searching algorithm's path changing behavior and to give a better portrayal on the difference of the routes for each searching algorithm. Instead of having one goal, 2 more goals are added for better path searching visualization. Besides, another aim for this study is to learn the process of understanding and modifying an existing python package. Hence, it can improve our overall understanding of codes written by other people. The modified pyamaze package is named pyamazeMod.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Every's searching algorithm will be given the same agent's start point and the three goals so that the comparisons are uniform. Two types of search algorithms are implemented, they are uninformed and informed search. Uninformed search is also known as \"blind search'. It only uses the information available in the problem defined. Informed search relies on additional information of the problem or domain through the use of heuristics for the optimal solution. Two types of uninformed and one type of informed search algorithms are used. For uninformed, Depth First Search and Breadth First Search algorithms are used whereas for informed, A-star Search algorithm is used.\n",
